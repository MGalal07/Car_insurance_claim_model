# Car Insurance Claims EDA & Model

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of a car insurance claims dataset aimed at understanding the factors influencing whether a customer will file a claim. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling using logistic regression.

## Project Objectives
- Identify the best predictor feature for insurance claims.
- Analyze various demographic, financial, and behavioral factors that influence claim likelihood.
- Provide insights for risk assessment and customer engagement strategies.
- Build logistic regression model, evaluate it and finalize it

## Jupyter notebook files
- The first notebook you may be interested to check will show how the EDA is down and what is our take on each step of it.
- The second notebook will show you how i built the logistic regression from preprocessing up to finalizing the model.

## Key Findings
- **Age**: Younger drivers (ages 16-25) are more likely to make claims.
- **Gender**: Males have a higher likelihood of claims compared to females.
- **Driving Experience**: Less experienced drivers (0-9 years) tend to file more claims.
- **Credit Score**: No significant difference in credit scores between claimants and non-claimants.
- **Annual Mileage**: Higher annual mileage correlates with increased claim likelihood.
- **Marital Status**: Unmarried individuals are more likely to file claims.
- **Children**: Families with children tend to make fewer claims.
- **Best Predictor**: The analysis identifies a specific feature that serves as the best predictor of claims.
